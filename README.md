# PRODIGY_CS_04
A Simple Keylogger project using Python is a basic program designed to monitor and record keystrokes made by a user on their computer. The project typically uses libraries such as pynput or keyboard to capture the input from the keyboard in real-time and save it to a file for later review.

Key Features:

1. Keystroke Logging: The core functionality is to capture every keystroke typed by the user, including special keys (like Enter, Shift, etc.).


2. Data Storage: The keystrokes can be logged in a text file, CSV, or any other format for easy retrieval and analysis.


3. Run in Background: The keylogger can run silently in the background without the user's knowledge.


4. Key Filtering (optional): Some versions may include filters to ignore certain keystrokes (e.g., system keys or specific key combinations).


5. Cross-Platform: The project can be implemented for both Windows and Linux/Mac OS, as Python libraries like pynput support multiple platforms.



Example Libraries Used:

pynput: Allows control and monitoring of input devices like keyboards and mice.

keyboard: Another Python library to hook into the keyboard and listen for key events.


Ethical Considerations:

While keyloggers can be used for educational purposes or for monitoring systems you own, they can also raise privacy concerns. It's crucial to use such tools responsibly and ensure they are not deployed without consent.
